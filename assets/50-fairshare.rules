/* PolicyKit rule to allow active users to run fairshare via pkexec without admin authentication
 *
 * This rule allows any active user to execute fairshare-bin via pkexec without
 * requiring root password authentication. This works in conjunction with org.fairshare.policy
 * to provide passwordless resource management for logged-in users.
 *
 * Installation: Automatically installed to /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-fairshare.rules
 *               during 'fairshare admin setup'
